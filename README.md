# Metro Route Planner

**Metro Route Planner** is a web application built using **Python** and **Streamlit** that helps users find the shortest route path in the **Delhi** and **Bangalore** metro systems. The application leverages advanced knowledge of data structures and algorithms (DSA) to provide efficient and accurate route planning.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Quickly find the shortest path between two metro stations.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Multiple Cities**: Supports metro route planning for both Delhi and Bangalore.
